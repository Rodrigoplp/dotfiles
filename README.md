# dotfiles
My dot files

- .vimrc

Package manager: Vungle

The other configurations are basically an attempt to change Vim's looks according to my preferences. I am still just a beginner and I don' know much about customizing it.

- .bash_profile

In the beginning of the file you will find color customizations. I'm quite proud of the result.
Some aliases to allow me to jump quicker to the folders I work more often.
And finally some shortcuts to speed up my use of Terminal.
